## ðŸ’» How to Run the Programs

You will need the **Emu8086 - Microprocessor Emulator** software to run these programs.

### Software Requirements
* **Software:** `Emu8086 v4.08`
* **Download:** You can search for "Emu8086 v4.08 download" on the internet to find and download it from various reliable educational or archive websites.

### Steps to Run
1.  First, install **Emu8086** on your computer.
2.  Download the desired `.asm` file from this repository.
3.  Launch the Emu8086 software and open the downloaded `.asm` file by clicking the **"Open"** button.
4.  Once the code is open in the editor, click the **"Assemble"** or **"Emulate"** button from the toolbar.
5.  If there are no errors, a new emulator window will open.
6.  In that new window, click the **"Run"** button to execute the entire program at once, or click **"Single Step"** to execute it line by line and observe the changes in the registers.

## ðŸ’¡ Understanding Program Output

The programs in this repository produce results that can be viewed in different ways.

* **Variables Window:** This window (**`View -> variables`** in the emulator) is a debugger tool that shows the real-time values stored in memory. For many of the arithmetic programs, this is the quickest way to see the final calculated value (e.g., the value in the `RESULT` or `QUOTIENT` variable).
* **Console Screen:** This is the black text-based window (`emulator screen`) where programs can print formatted messages using `INT 21h`.
* **Virtual Device:** Some programs interface with hardware and require a specific virtual device (e.g., `LED_Display.exe`) to be opened to see the visual output.
